Atop your trusty pulse steed, you set off to the Ship Wreck. It's been there a
month or so. But about half of it is already gone. It was the biggest ship you
have ever seen, when it still flew.

When you looked up, you had to turn your head to see all of it as it flew
overhead.

Before you know it you arrive at the impact zone. Static and the smell of metal
fills the air! All I see is aluminum, the outer armour layer has long been
"salvaged".

It's almost dark, and you only have the outer brim of light left to light the
ship. Nights can be harsh in this almost desert environment.
