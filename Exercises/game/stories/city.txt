The city is a far ways away. It used to be California, but nothing remains
that identifies it. Nowadays it's just the people who have the courage or
stupidity to move back, and loot what they can.

It's started to look like something again, something we only saw in images
shared by old men. People have learnt to use the land to live. Their dwellings
more nature, than building. Normally struck together in trees, or dug into the
sand. Tin and lumber still remains the most readily available.

My trusty bike, will get me there in just a few minutes. She was an old bike
with a dodge pulse drive, but she got me wherever I need to go without fail.
A little shock every now and again is worth it. As we float over the sand and
cobble, with patches of tar and rubble in between. You only really spot life
every now and again.

People out gathering for the day. The city itself was really only a large
collection of dwellings strung together. Just to make it easier for people to
trade their goods or services.

I was looking for Toren, the missing husband. His wife had last heard that he
was going to the edge of the market place to trade his goods he made by hand.

So I started at the only place I really knew. The city tavern "City Rat". It
was an ok place, but the ale was terrible. Tasted of piss and vinegar.
