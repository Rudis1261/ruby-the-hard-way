It takes a day of riding to get to the Ship, so hopefully you make it in time
before they set off on their next plunder.

On the way there, you start to think. has this bounty hunting life been what
you wanted? It's bee na lucrative life, but also a lonely one. You have pretty
much done whatever your wanted and gone wherever you wanted.

A pirate ship, and shipmates could indeed be all together more exciting and
you will never be lonely again. Heck who knows, maybe you might even find a
honey to call wifu, and settle down.

When you arrive at the ship, you start off towards the main door. It's open
so you head on in knocking on the tick metal. Next thing you hear is "HALT WHO GOES THERE?", and the
sound of a plasma rifle charging.

You freeze
