The Gold Mine seems to be abandoned, but the entrance doors are slightly
cracked. You approach carefully, and as you get closer you hear voices
seems two guys are arguing but you can't quite make out what they are
saying.

Things seem to be heating up, maybe should crack the door a bit more to
hear....
