The aluminum smell seems to be getting stronger. How is that possible? The
air is almost thick, and thickening my the moment.

I can't recall what happened to the ship, why it crash landed?? Suddenly a cold
shiver runs down your spine. I can swear the air I am breathing is moving as I
inhale. That's not normal. o.O

My body gets heavy, and icy cold. SOMETHING IS INSIDE ME. I can feel it moving
my internals, ripping at me. My legs give way. And I fall down. I can't move.
My body falls to the ground... And everything turns black...
